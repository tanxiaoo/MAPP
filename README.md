# DIMA Course Project Repository

This is the repository for the projects of the Design and Implementation of Mobile Application (DIMA) course held in 2024 at Polimi.

The project aims to design and implement a multi-platform application using flutter
  
## Project Background  

For this project, we have been selected to work on **Trenord: Scenario 7 - Features for Train Tourism**. The objective is to create an application that enhances the tourist experience for railway travelers, enabling them to:  

- **Plan personalized itineraries** using rail transport as the primary mode of travel.  
- **Access integrated information** about attractions, accommodations, and restaurants along their route, ensuring a comprehensive and enjoyable tourist experience.  

To achieve this, the project leverages the **E015 API catalog** provided by **Regione Lombardia**, offering a wide array of data sources, such as:  

- Parking availability  
- Metro and railway line statuses  
- Local events  
- Territory details  
- Points of interest  
- Weather alerts  

For more information, you can visit the [E015 API catalog](https://www.e015.regione.lombardia.it/site/api-catalog).  

By combining these features with user-friendly design and robust technology, the project aims to deliver a seamless and delightful experience for train-based tourism enthusiasts.
