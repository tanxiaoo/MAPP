# DIMA Course Project Repository

This is the repository for the projects of the Design and Implementation of Mobile Application (DIMA) course held in 2024 at Polimi.

The project aims to design and implement a multi-platform application using one of the technologies demonstrated during the course

## Project Ideas

As part of the project discussions, we are currently exploring various ideas for applications. 

### First Idea: A Travel-Related Mobile Application

One of the initial concepts focuses on the following features:

1. **Interactive Map Marking**: Users will be able to mark the countries and regions they have visited on an interactive map. By clicking on a country, they can confirm their visit, which will visually highlight that area on the map. This feature aims to provide users with an intuitive way to visualize their travel experiences.

2. **Footprint Counting and Display**: The app will automatically count the total number of countries visited by the user and prominently display this information. Additionally, it will provide a percentage breakdown of visits by continent, helping users understand their travel habits and inspiring them to explore new destinations.

#### Case Study: Been App

The "Been" app serves as a relevant case study for our first idea. It allows users to track their travel history by marking countries they have visited. The app features an intuitive interface where users can easily see their travel footprint on a world map. Key functionalities such as country statistics, travel summaries, and visual progress tracking have inspired our approach to developing similar features in our application.
